###   *Introduction:*


Music has the power to stimulate strong emotions within us, to the extent that it is probably rare not to be somehow emotionally affected by music. We all know what emotions are and experience them daily. Most of us also listen to music in order to experience emotions.
Music can be thought of as a type of perceptual illusion, much the same way in which a collage is perceived. The brain imposes structure and order on a sequence of sounds that, in effect, creates an entirely new system of meaning. The appreciation of music is tied to the ability to process its underlying structure â€” the ability to predict what will occur next in the song. 


Through my app, I hope to make this prediction while adding additional features. Through facial expressions, the user can pause, play and change songs, providing hands-free capability. Also, to help predict whether the user likes or dislikes a song, emotions such as happiness, sadness and excitement are detected.

### *Facial Expressionss:*


1) Blink Eyes- Pause the song

2) Open Mouth- Resume/Play the song

3) Widen Eyes- Change songs


### *Songs:*

I have a selection of popular songs ranging from pop to hip-hop.


### *Scope for Improvement:*


1) It would be great to integrate the use of the Spotify API to allow the user to select songs of his or her choice.

2) Improve the tracking accuracy which is currently bound by the limitations of the library.


### *Guide to Libraries*


1) Libraries used are ofxCv, ofxGui, ofxFaceTracker, ofxOpenCv

2) Clone the ofxFaceTracker and ofxCv libraries from the following git account- https://github.com/kylemcdonald

3) Add the cloned libraries to the addons folder within openframeworks

4) ofxGui, and  ofxOpenCv are included within the addons by default

5) Create a new project and include the required addons

6) Add in the expression files from the ofxFaceTracker library installed

7) The project should run. Congratulations! You are all set to go!
